# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HumanReplies is an AI-powered browser extension that automatically generates context-aware, on-brand replies, comments, and messages across multiple social media platforms and email services. The system learns the user's unique writing style and tone to produce authentic responses that maintain personal touch while scaling online interactions. The project includes a Next.js web application with Supabase backend for cross-platform data persistence, Clerk authentication, and social account management, alongside the core browser extension functionality.
