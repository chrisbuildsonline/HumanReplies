# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HumanReplies is an AI-powered browser extension that automatically generates context-aware, on-brand replies, comments, and messages across all web platforms. The system enables users to define their unique writing style and tone preferences to produce authentic responses that maintain personal touch while scaling online interactions. The project includes a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database, dual Next.js applications (dashboard and landing page), Supabase authentication, Redis caching, and privacy-first analytics, alongside the core browser extension functionality.

## Architecture Evolution

This specification reflects the evolved implementation that diverged from the original design during development. Key changes include:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with PostgreSQL instead of Next.js API routes
- **Authentication**: Optional Supabase auth instead of required Clerk
- **Privacy**: No content storage, only usage analytics
- **Features**: Custom tone system, writing style settings, comprehensive dashboard
- **Platform Support**: Universal web platform support with site-specific mode

**User Story:** As a user concerned about authenticity, I want to review and edit generated replies before posting, so that I maintain control over my online presence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replies are generated THEN the system SHALL present them in an editable interface before posting
2. WHEN a user makes edits THEN the system SHALL save these modifications to improve future generations
3. WHEN the user approves content THEN the system SHALL provide a one-click posting mechanism

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a social media strategist, I want replies to include subtle engagement hooks, so that my responses drive meaningful conversations and interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating replies THEN the system SHALL include relevant questions, insights, or conversation starters
2. WHEN creating engagement hooks THEN the system SHALL ensure they feel natural and not forced
3. WHEN analyzing successful replies THEN the system SHALL identify effective engagement patterns for future use
4. IF a reply lacks engagement potential THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements or alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to optionally authenticate and access a comprehensive dashboard, so that my writing style, preferences, and usage analytics are available across different browsers and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web application THEN users SHALL be able to authenticate via Supabase integration (optional)
2. WHEN logged in THEN users SHALL access a dashboard with usage analytics, settings management, and tone customization
3. WHEN user data is saved THEN it SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL via FastAPI backend with privacy-first approach
4. WHEN users are not authenticated THEN the extension SHALL still function with default settings
5. IF a user switches browsers or devices THEN their authenticated settings SHALL remain available

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my writing style and create custom tones, so that the system can generate replies that match my authentic voice and preferred communication styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing user settings THEN the system SHALL provide fields for writing style instructions and guardian text configuration
2. WHEN users create custom tones THEN the system SHALL save these alongside preset tones (professional, friendly, supportive, etc.)
