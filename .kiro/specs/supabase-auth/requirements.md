# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Supabase authentication for the HumanReplies browser extension and web application to enable user tracking, usage monitoring, and freemium monetization. The system will provide seamless authentication across the browser extension and web dashboard, with support for social logins and user analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up and log in to HumanReplies using my email or social accounts, so that I can access personalized features and track my usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the extension popup for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a login/signup interface
2. WHEN a user clicks "Sign up with Email" THEN the system SHALL create a new account with email verification
3. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL authenticate via Google OAuth
4. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with GitHub" THEN the system SHALL authenticate via GitHub OAuth
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the session securely in the extension
6. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the extension SHALL automatically log them in on startup

### Requirement 2: Cross-Platform Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to work seamlessly between the browser extension and web dashboard, so that I don't need to authenticate multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in through the extension THEN the web dashboard SHALL recognize the same session
2. WHEN a user logs in through the web dashboard THEN the extension SHALL sync the authentication state
3. WHEN a user logs out from either platform THEN both platforms SHALL clear the session
4. WHEN the session expires THEN both platforms SHALL prompt for re-authentication
5. IF the user is offline THEN the extension SHALL maintain the last known auth state until reconnection

### Requirement 3: Usage Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to track user engagement and feature usage, so that I can optimize the product and identify conversion opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates a reply THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp and platform
2. WHEN a user posts a generated reply THEN the system SHALL track the completion event
3. WHEN a user reaches usage limits THEN the system SHALL record the limit-hit event
4. WHEN a user accesses premium features THEN the system SHALL log feature usage
5. IF a user is anonymous THEN the system SHALL NOT track any personal data

### Requirement 4: Freemium Usage Limits

**User Story:** As a free user, I want to understand my usage limits and upgrade options, so that I can make informed decisions about premium features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free user generates replies THEN the system SHALL track usage against monthly limits
2. WHEN a user approaches their limit (80%) THEN the system SHALL display a warning notification
3. WHEN a user exceeds their free limit THEN the system SHALL block further usage and show upgrade options
4. WHEN a user upgrades to premium THEN the system SHALL immediately unlock unlimited usage
5. WHEN usage resets monthly THEN the system SHALL notify users of their refreshed limits

### Requirement 5: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my account settings and view my usage statistics, so that I can control my experience and monitor my activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display current usage statistics
2. WHEN a user wants to change their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification
3. WHEN a user wants to delete their account THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and remove all data
4. WHEN a user connects social accounts THEN the system SHALL store OAuth tokens securely
5. WHEN a user disconnects social accounts THEN the system SHALL revoke tokens and remove permissions

### Requirement 6: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication data and personal information to be secure, so that I can trust the application with my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data
2. WHEN transmitting user data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
3. WHEN a user's session is inactive for 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically expire the session
4. WHEN detecting suspicious login activity THEN the system SHALL require additional verification
5. IF there's a security breach THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate all sessions and notify users

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Offline Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to work reliably even with poor internet connectivity, so that I can continue using the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry automatically with exponential backoff
2. WHEN the user is offline THEN the extension SHALL use cached authentication state
3. WHEN Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
5. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync authentication state
